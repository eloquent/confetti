     * the $isEnd argument.

     * this variable will persist until the stream transformation is complete.
     * It can be used as a place to store state, such as a buffer.
     *
     * It is guaranteed that this method will be called with $isEnd = true once,
     * and only once, at the end of the stream transformation.
     *
     * @param string  $data     The data to transform.
     * @param mixed   &$context An arbitrary context value.
     * @param boolean $isEnd    True if all supplied data must be transformed.
     *
     * @return tuple<string,integer,mixed> A 3-tuple of the transformed data, the number of bytes consumed, and any resulting error.
